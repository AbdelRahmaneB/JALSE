JALSE
=====
Java Artificial Life Simulation Engine is a lightweight framework for simple simulation written in Java 8. See JALSE-TestTown2 (https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE-Testtown2) for my testing ground!

I use JProfiler for performance tuning (http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html).
