JALSE: Java Artificial Life Simulation Engine
=====
JALSE is a lightweight framework for simple simulation written in Java 8. See JALSE-HappyCows (https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE-HappyCows) for an example!

I use JProfiler for performance tuning (http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html).
