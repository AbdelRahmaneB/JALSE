## [JALSE](https://ellzord.github.io/JALSE) - Java Artificial Life Simulation Engine
By Elliot Ford

JALSE is a lightweight framework for simple simulation written in Java 8. The framework provides dyanmic yet typed entities that can be processed concurrently. The underlying implementation is up to you - by default its there but it can be replaced.
