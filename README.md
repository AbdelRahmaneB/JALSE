##JALSE - Java Artificial Life Simulation Engine
JALSE is a lightweight framework for simple simulation written in Java 8. Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki) for more information and have a look at [HappyCows](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE-HappyCows) for an example project!

I use [JProfiler](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) for performance tuning.
