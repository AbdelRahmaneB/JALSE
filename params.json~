{"name":"JALSE","tagline":"Java Artificial Life Simulation Engine","body":"JALSE is a lightweight entity framework for simulation written in Java 8. The framework is used to create a dynamic living data-model for your entity based simulation or game. By default all JALSE entities can have their attributes and child entities concurrently processed and mutated (no need for additional synchronisation).\r\n\r\nJALSE takes entities one step further by allowing the user to create Entity types. Unlike classic Java objects JALSE entities can have multiple types and 'casting' to another type causes no issues (just null fields). As well as making use of typing (```cow.isMooing()```) entities can be grouped and processed by entity type. Inheritance still is at play here so I can be sure to ```feed()``` every ```Animal``` but only ```moo()``` a ```Cow```!\r\n\r\nUse JALSE for when you need to start processing a large number of entities or if you want a structured way to increase the level of detail kept about an entity (rather than adding yet another field).\r\n\r\nFounded by [Elliot Ford](https://twitter.com/ellzord)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nSee the [Wiki](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki) for full documentation, examples and project information.\r\n\r\nSee the [API docs](http://ellzord.github.io/JALSE/docs/).\r\n\r\n### Getting the latest release\r\nJALSE [releases](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/releases) and (SNAPSHOTs) are published to maven central (http://search.maven.org/).\r\n\r\nExample for Maven:\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.github.ellzord</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>JALSE</artifactId>\r\n    <version>1.0.6</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for Gradle:\r\n```\r\ncompile 'com.github.ellzord:JALSE:1.0.6'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n* [Example projects](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki/Example-projects)\r\n* [Code snippets](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki/Code-snippets)\r\n* [How to contribute](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki/How-to-contribute)\r\n* [Have bugs or questions?](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki/Have-bugs-or-questions%3F)\r\n* [Class diagram](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki/Class-diagram)\r\n* [Technologies we use](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki/Technologies-we-use)\r\n* [Example use cases](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki/Example-use-cases)\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\nCode is under the [Apache Licence v2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
