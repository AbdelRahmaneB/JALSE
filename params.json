{"name":"JALSE","tagline":"Java Artificial Life Simulation Engine","body":"### What is JALSE?\r\nJALSE is a lightweight framework for simple simulation written in Java 8. The framework provides dynamic yet typed entities that can be processed concurrently. The underlying implementation is up to you - by default its there but it can be replaced.\r\n\r\nBy [Elliot Ford](https://twitter.com/ellzord)\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n* [Download](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/blob/gh-pages/JALSE-0.1.0.jar?raw=true) or [fork](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/) JALSE.\r\n* Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki).\r\n* See the [API docs](http://ellzord.github.io/JALSE/docs/).\r\n* Have a look at the example projects ([HappyCows](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE-HappyCows) and [Messengers](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE-Messengers)).\r\n\r\n### Going forward\r\nJALSE is still in development - to find out what is on the horizon see [Enhancements](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) and [Future changes](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki/Future-changes)!\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\nSee [LICENCE](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/blob/master/LICENSE).\r\n\r\n### Shout-outs\r\nI use [JProfiler](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) for performance tuning.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
